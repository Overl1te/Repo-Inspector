Repo Inspector is built with an engineering-first culture.
Short version: **respect, evidence, ownership, zero toxicity**.

## Our commitment

We are committed to a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality,
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected behavior

- Critique code, never people.
- Keep discussions evidence-based and actionable.
- Document decisions transparently in issues/PRs.
- Respect collaborators' time with reproducible reports and clear context.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Insults, threats, harassment, or discriminatory language.
- Trolling, flamebait, or intentionally derailing reviews.
- Publishing personal data without explicit consent.
- Security sabotage (hiding vulnerabilities, leaking secrets, malicious PRs).

## Scope

This policy applies in:

- Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions;
- code reviews, commit comments, docs;
- external public spaces where someone represents the project.

## Reporting

- GitHub Issues: <https://github.com/Overl1te/Repo-Inspector/issues>
- Security reports: see `SECURITY_EN.md`
- Maintainer profile: <https://github.com/Overl1te>

Helpful report details:

- what happened;
- where/when;
- links, screenshots, logs.

## Enforcement

Depending on severity and recurrence:

1. Notice and request to correct behavior.
2. Warning and temporary interaction limits.
3. Temporary ban.
4. Permanent ban.

## Moderation principle

Moderation exists to restore productive collaboration.
Less drama, more shipped quality.
