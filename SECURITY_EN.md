Thanks for helping keep Repo Inspector secure.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided on a best-effort basis for:

| Branch/version | Status |
|---|---|
| `main` | Supported |
| Latest release | Supported |
| Older releases | No guarantee |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please avoid public disclosure before maintainers can assess and patch.

Preferred channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisory:  
   <https://github.com/Overl1te/Repo-Inspector/security/advisories/new>
2. If unavailable, contact maintainer:  
   <https://github.com/Overl1te>

## Include in report

- concise description;
- reproduction steps;
- potential impact;
- affected versions/commits;
- PoC (if safe);
- proposed mitigation (optional).

## SLA (best effort)

| Phase | Target |
|---|---|
| Acknowledgement | within 72 hours |
| Initial triage | within 7 days |
| Fix/mitigation plan | within 14 days |

Complex issues may require additional time.

## Coordinated disclosure

- Patch/mitigation first, public disclosure after.
- Reporter credit is provided on request.
- Technical details may be published after a fix release.

## Scope

This policy covers:

- backend/API and background workers;
- SVG/JSON endpoints;
- in-repo workflow automations.

External systems (GitHub, OSV, hosting providers) follow their own policies.
